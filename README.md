This repository contains two distinct Rust libraries focused on supporting SPIRE functionalities:

## [spiffe](./spiffe)

The `spiffe` crate enables interaction with
the [SPIFFE Workload API](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_API.md). It allows
fetching of X.509 and JWT SVIDs, bundles, and supports watch/stream updates. The types in the library are in compliance
with [SPIFFE standards](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/tree/main/standards). More about SPIFFE can be found
at [spiffe.io](https://spiffe.io/).

- [Read the README](./spiffe/README.md) for more information.

## [spire-api](./spire-api)

The `spire-api` crate provides support for SPIRE specific APIs, including the Delegated Identity API.

- [Read the README](./spire-api/README.md) for more information.
