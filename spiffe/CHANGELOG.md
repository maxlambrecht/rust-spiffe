# Changelog

## [0.11.2] – 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Ensure observability macros always consume their arguments to avoid
  `unused_variable` warnings when neither `logging` nor `tracing` is enabled.
- Resolve clippy warnings in edge-case feature combinations.

### Notes
- No public API changes.


## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed

* Fixed incorrect retry behavior when the Workload API returns `NoIdentityIssued`, avoiding tight retry loops and excessive log noise.
* Ensured consistent retry and backoff semantics across X.509 and JWT supervisors.

### Changed

* Refactored shared supervisor logic into a new `supervisor_common` module to remove duplication and improve maintainability.
* Improved supervisor diagnostics, including clearer lifecycle, recovery, and stream connectivity logging.

### Security / Hardening

* Enforced a maximum X.509 certificate chain length (16) to mitigate resource-exhaustion inputs.
* Clarified parsing behavior by allowing unbounded X.509 bundles while keeping certificate chains bounded.
* Enforced the SPIFFE spec maximum URI length (2048 bytes) for SPIFFE IDs.
* Capped JWT-SVID `aud` claim entries (32) during deserialization to limit pre-verification allocations.


## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-18

### Highlights
- **New: `JwtSource`** — high-level API for automatic JWT bundle watching and cached, on-demand JWT-SVID fetching.  
  Provides API parity with `X509Source` and aligns with the canonical SPIFFE implementation (go-spiffe).

### Added
- `JwtSource`, a managed source for JWT bundles and JWT-SVIDs backed by the Workload API.
- Automatic JWT bundle watching with in-memory caching and rotation handling.
- On-demand JWT-SVID fetching via `get_jwt_svid()` and `get_jwt_svid_with_id()`.
- Update notifications through the `updated()` handle.
- Configurable resource limits for bundle count and JWKS size.
- Optional metrics recorder integration.
- Health checks via `is_healthy()`.
- Graceful shutdown support (`shutdown()` and `shutdown_with_timeout()`).
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff on transient failures.

### Notes
- This is an additive change and does not introduce breaking API changes.
- `JwtSource` is opt-in and does not affect existing `X509Source` behavior.


## [0.10.2] – 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- Fixed `to_certificate_vec` to preserve original DER bytes when parsing certificate chains, ensuring byte-for-byte equality with input data.

### Changed

- Improved performance of URI SAN extraction by iterating directly over `general_names` and applying early filtering for SPIFFE IDs.
- Added security bounds to URI SAN processing: a maximum of 32 URI SAN entries and 2048 bytes per URI, preventing resource exhaustion from malformed or adversarial certificates.
- Changed `MissingX509Extension` error variant to use `Oid<'static>` instead of `String` for better type safety and consistency with `oid_registry` constants.

### Added

- Added `TooManyUriSanEntries` error variant to `CertificateError` for certificates exceeding the URI SAN entry limit.
- Added tests covering certificate parsing edge cases and error conditions.


## [0.10.1] – 2026-01-05

### Changed

- Improved performance of SPIFFE ID and TrustDomain parsing by switching to byte-level validation, reducing allocations, and optimizing common parsing paths.

### Added

- Added fuzz targets for SPIFFE ID and TrustDomain parsing to validate parser invariants and harden input handling.


## [0.10.0] – 2026-01-03

### Breaking changes

- Default feature set is now empty (`default = []`). Feature-gated capabilities (Workload API, X.509 parsing, JWT, etc.) must be explicitly enabled.
- `X509Source::new()` return type changed from `Arc<X509Source>` to `X509Source` (cloneable).
- Module layout changes: X.509 source moved to `spiffe::x509_source`; endpoint parsing moved under `spiffe::transport`.

### Added / Changed

- Clear feature matrix separating X.509, JWT, transport, and Workload API concerns.
- Heavy X.509 and JWT parsing dependencies are now fully feature-gated (`x509`, `jwt`).
- New Workload API tiers: `workload-api-core`, `workload-api-x509`, `workload-api-jwt`, `workload-api-full`
  (`workload-api` remains an alias for `-full`).
- Improved endpoint parsing: supports `tcp:IP:PORT`, IPv6, stricter unix path validation, and `FromStr`.
- Polished `X509Source` builder API and documentation.
- Integration tests are now feature-gated and `#[ignore]`.

**Migration:** see `docs/migration-spiffe-0.10.md`.


## [0.9.2] – 2025-12-30

### Changed

- Expose `Endpoint` and `EndpointError` in `transport` feature.


## [0.9.1] – 2025-12-30

### Changed

- Observability is now fully opt-in via features:
  - `logging` enables `log`
  - `tracing` enables `tracing`
  - precedence: `tracing` > `logging` > no-op
- `workload-api` no longer enables `log` implicitly (reduced default dependency surface).

### Documentation

- Documented observability feature precedence and clarified that features are additive / opt-in.

### Migration notes

- If you relied on `workload-api` enabling logging implicitly, enable `logging` explicitly:
  `spiffe = { version = "0.9.1", features = ["workload-api", "logging"] }`


## [0.9.0] – 2025-12-30

### Breaking changes

- Offline JWT verification is now feature-gated.
  - `JwtSvid::parse_and_validate` requires enabling a `jwt-verify-*` feature.
- `SvidPicker::pick_svid` now returns `Option<usize>` instead of a reference.
- Internal feature renamed: `grpc` → `transport`.
- `GrpcClientError` replaced by `WorkloadApiError` and `TransportError`.
- MSRV bumped from 1.83 to 1.85.

### Added

- X509Source hardening:
  - Resource limits (SVIDs, bundles, bundle size)
  - Graceful shutdown with timeout
  - Metrics hooks and categorized error reporting
- Optional `tracing` feature for structured logging.
- New `X509SourceUpdates` API for update notifications.
- Stricter and more defensive JWT / JWKS parsing.

### Changed

- `JwtBundleSet` now uses deterministic ordering (`BTreeMap`).
- Default dependency and cryptography surface reduced via feature gating.

### Deprecated

- `JwtBundleSet::bundle_for` (use `get` instead).


## [0.8.0] – 2025-12-26

### Breaking changes

- Removed the `spiffe-types` feature; core SPIFFE types are now always enabled.
- Refactored `WorkloadApiClient` to be non-mutable; all client methods now take `&self`.
- Removed legacy `Bundle`, `BundleRefSource`, `Svid`, and `SvidRefSource` traits.
- Introduced `BundleSource` and `SvidSource` returning shared `Arc` values.
- Standardized bundle lookup APIs (`get_bundle*` → `bundle_for*`).
- Replaced string-based socket handling with a typed `Endpoint` abstraction.
- Updated JWT-SVID parsing to use spec-correct `exp` handling.
- Refined `GrpcClientError` with explicit semantic variants and gRPC status mapping.

### Added

- First-class support for SVID hints for both X.509 and JWT identities.
- Multi-SVID fetch APIs and hint-based JWT SVID selection.
- Explicit Unix and TCP endpoint handling with strict validation.

- Added `X509Source::x509_context()` convenience method to retrieve a snapshot of the current X.509 SVIDs and bundle set.

### Documentation

- Fixed doctest examples to correctly handle `Option`-returning APIs (`default_svid()`).
- Updated examples to use `bundle_set()` instead of non-existent `bundles()` accessor.
- Clarified `X509Source` as the primary entry point for X.509 workloads.
- Improved overall structure and readability of crate-level docs.

### Notes
